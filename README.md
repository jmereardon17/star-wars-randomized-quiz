# Star Wars randomized quiz

A Star Wars themed randomized quiz using HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery.

I created my own quiz and used an array literal to store objects containing the quiz questions and choices. I used JavaScript to randomize the quiz questions and also the choices each time the page is loaded to give a new appearance for players.

I utilized jQuery's fadeIn and fadeOut methods to give the app it's visuals.
